Parts are needed for most construction processes. It is highly advised to invest into fabrication cost reduction officers to get a discount on all blueprints.

Once you get into T3 parts production, you will need a new resource type called **gas** (**GU**), that comes in E, F, G and H varieties. This can be found from several sources:

- All Gasses can be harvested gas from a Jovian Planet using Gas Collectors.
- Scannable and liaison missions.
- All gases are available from the clan market.
- T3 Gas:
  - E, F & G Gas is avialable from the various faction liaison requistion shops sell and you can buy 4 packs of 250 gas per day (Iyatequa for E, Tanoch for F, and Yaot have for G).
  - H Gas is available from the Prestige market.
  - H Gas is available from the travelling trader.
- T4 Gas:
  - E, F & G Gas is available from some Amassari salvage

At T4, another resource type called **composites** (**CU**) are be introduced. These are created by refining **crystals** with T4 REs. Crystals are currently available from:

- Scanned mission rewards
- Travelling trader
- Clan market

Composites are avialable from:

- Market (for Adamanat)
- Your refineries (as long as you have T4 REs and T4 crystals)
