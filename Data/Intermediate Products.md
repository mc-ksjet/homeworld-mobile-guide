Parts are needed for most T2 and T3 construction processes. It is highly advised to invest into fabrication cost reduction officers to get a discount on all blueprints.

Once you get into T3 parts production, you will need a new resource type called gas. This can be found from two sources:
The various liaison factions sell 4 x 250 gas per day (Iyatequa has gas E, Tanoch have gas F and the Yaot have gas G)
It also drops from T3 scannable and liaison missions, this is also you only source for gas H
